- Reworked custom recipe into the new system. Now the recipe will show its correct output instead of a knowledge book, both in the crafting table output and in the recipe book.
- Removed advancements. Now those are only available in the full Vegancraft datapack.
- Added "give" function for the magnet rod. The command is ``/function dnv.magnet_fishing:give/magnet_fishing_rod``
