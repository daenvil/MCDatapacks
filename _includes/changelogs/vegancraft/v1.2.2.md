Datapack updated for Minecraft 1.21.2+

Additions:
- Added new recipes for trial keys:
	- A trial key can be crafted with polished tuff, a lighning rod, and obsidian.
	- An ominous trial key can be crafted with polished tuff, a blaze rod, and crying obsidian.
	- The intention with these recipes is to add a way to avoid having to fight the trial chamber mobs in order to open the vaults. Now you can craft keys beforehand and sneak into the chambers to try and get loot without hurting mobs.

Fixes:
- Fixed non-vegan ingredients sometimes producing vegan outputs.
- Fixed wrong conditions for unlocking the totem of undying recipe.
