Ethical textiles:
- Increased the output yield of faux leather recipes from 1 to 3.
- Added a new recipe for item frames which uses paper instead of leather.

Other:
- Added a new recipe for the Eye of Ender (which I forgot in the previous update): it's crafted with a compass, blaze powder, and crying obsidian.
- Increased the output yield of the gunpowder recipe from 1 to 3.
- Tide armor trims can now be found in ocean ruin chests with around a 10% chance.
- Sponges can now be found by brushing suspicious sand/gravel in ocean ruins with a 6.7% chance (they replace iron axes in the vanilla loot table).
- End's mist recipe (Dragon's breath) now uses a glass bottle instead of an experience bottle.
- Killing piglins no longer counts as killing a non-hostile animal for the purpose of a hidden advancement.
- The nether star recipe was changed to be cheaper. Now it requires 4 netherite ingots instead of a netherite block. The recipe now is: blaze powder surrounded by 4 diamonds and 4 netherite ingots.
- Nether star now appears as a rare loot in ancient city chests (same probability as disc fragments and enchanted golden apples).
