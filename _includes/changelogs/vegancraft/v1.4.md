Additions:
- **Resin clumps** are now obtainable by stripping pale oak logs and wood
	- When a pale oak log/wood is stripped there's a chance that a resin clump appears on its surface
	- This chance is the same as for getting acacia gum from stripping acacias (Fortune enchantment also affects it)

- Acacia gum balls are now **throwable with right click**
	- They can be picked up again (they aren't destroyed)
	- They don't hurt and don't make mobs angry when hit

- Villagers and wandering traders have **new trades** to compensate their non-vegan trades:
	- There might be a bug where some villagers don't seem to have the custom trades at first, but they should fix themselves after some time passes (~5s). This is a necessary tradeoff to improve performance of the datapack (otherwise villagers would need to be checked multiple times every second). This will not improve until Mojang adds proper customizable trades.
	- See the list of all custom trades in [the datapack's page](vegancraft.html#villager-trades)

- The vegan alternative of the Eye of Ender is now called an "Ender Compass" and has its own texture (it's still crafted and used in the same way as before)

- A couple new advancements related to the new features

Changes:
- Plant wax can no longer be obtained from jungle leaves, since those now produce leaf litter in 1.21.5
	- Plant wax can now be obtained from smelting jungle saplings instead
- Vegan shulker boxes are now called "chorus boxes"
- Changed trident recipe, now requiring a heart of the sea (the recipe now is: heart of the sea, 2 prismarine crystals, blaze rod, and 3 diamond swords)
- End's mist recipe (vegan dragon's breath) now uses a chorus flower instead of a fruit (this was a mistake, as the recipe was always listed with chorus flower in the datapack docs)
- Lodestones and tridents can now be obtained by magnet fishing (with very low probabilities)
- Any fishing rods obtained by magnet fishing are now also magnet fishing rods
- Ancient cities and strongholds now have a very small chance of having trial keys in their loot
- Minor changes to how the vegan recipes for tridents, trial keys, eyes of ender, and shulker boxes are learned in-game
- Enchanted books containing curses can no longer be obtained by magnet fishing

Fixes:
- Adapted to work with Minecraft 1.21.5
- Fixed wrong output when crafting a seitan stew with animal meat
- Fixed some wrong enchanted books being obtainable by magnet fishing
