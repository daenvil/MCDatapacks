Additions:

- Added new public commands (require admin privileges or cheats enabled):
	- ``dnv.vegancraft:toggle_xp_from_crops_require_player``: controls whether xp drops from crops when they are destroyed by anything other than a player. Basically allows for AFK xp farms. I recommend requiring players if the server is laggy.
	- ``scoreboard players set #dnv dnv.xp_from_crops_multiplier <X>``: replace ``<X>`` by an integer number between 1 and 50 (default 1). Multiplies all xp obtained from crops by that number.

Changes:

- Re-balanced all xp granted by crops (now it's a bit higher by default), check the website for all the values
- Slightly reduced chances of getting crossbows, fishing rods, and tridents from magnet fishing treasure
