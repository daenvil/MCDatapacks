- Added a new item: **Armor Scale**, which has the same usage as the armadillo scute. Crafted with 2 strings, 1 slime ball, and 1 diamond (1 craft provides 2 scales).
- Added an alternative **brush** recipe that uses 4 strings instead of a feather.
- Reworked all custom recipes into the new system. Now custom recipes will show their correct output instead of a knowledge book, both in the crafting table output and in the recipe book.
- Removed advancements. Now those are only available in the full Vegancraft datapack.
- Added "give" functions for every custom item. The command is ``/function dnv.ethical_textiles:give/<item_id>``
