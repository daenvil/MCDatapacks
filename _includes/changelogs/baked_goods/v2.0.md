- All items now have their own "give" function, which can be used to give yourself the food if you have admin privileges or cheats turned on. The command is ``/function dnv.baking:give/<item_id>``.
  - E.g. ``/function dnv.baking:give/golden_carrot_pie`` will give you a golden carrot pie.
- Adapted recipes to new format, hugely simplifying the datapack and allowing the custom items to appear in the recipe book as if they were regular vanilla items.
- New nutrition and saturation values to all foods except cake slices (see the table below). Each food now has these values roughly calculated from their ingredients, so they are more balanced.
- All cookies added by this datapack, the sponge cakes, and custard tart are now twice as fast to eat (0.8 seconds).
- Glow berry foods now also provide the glowing effect.
- Holding chorus fruit pies no longer attracts endermen and eating a chorus fruit pie no longer angers nearby endermen.
- Some items, such as foods with golden carrots or apples now have a "rarity" level, showing their name in a different color.
- Changes to existing recipes:
  - The egg-based pies now require only 1 of their main ingredient instead of 2.
  - Custard tart recipe now requires an additional egg (to avoid conflict with cream pie recipe)
  - The sponge cake and custard tart recipes now output 2 items instead of 1.
- Adapted to work with any ``player.block_interaction_range`` attribute value.
- Optimized the chorus fruit pie's teleport mechanic using the ``random`` command.
- Fixed bug where golden carrot cake special effects were not being granted when eating its last slice.
