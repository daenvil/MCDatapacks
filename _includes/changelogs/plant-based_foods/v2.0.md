- Added three new food items:
  - **Seitan Stew**: same as rabbit stew but crafted with a seitan steak.
  - **Veggie Burger**: crafted with bread, beetroot, and brown mushroom.
  -  **Not-salmon Fillet**: crafted with carrot, kelp, and vegan honey. It acts as raw salmon (so you can feed it to cats and dolphins) but gives the same hunger points and saturation as cooked salmon.
- **Not-fish fillet** now gives the same hunger points and saturation as cooked cod (but keeps acting the same as raw cod).
- The **seitan steak** recipe no longer requires a bucket of water. Now it's just wheat + mushroom/beetroot stew. Now it's also shapeless (can be crafted without a crafting table).
- Reworked all custom recipes into the new system. Now custom recipes will show their correct output instead of a knowledge book, both in the crafting table output and in the recipe book.
- Removed advancements. Now those are only available in the full Vegancraft datapack.
- Added "give" functions for every custom item. The command is ``/function dnv.vegan_food:give/<item_id>``
