- Updated for Minecraft 1.20:
  - Added new 1.20 items (Calibrated Sculk Sensor is now compostable).
  - Optimized datapack by using item modifiers, modifying entity selectors, and implementing the new `return` command.
  - Improved datapack logo.
  - Changed pack_format to 14.
  - Datapack is no longer compatible with older Minecraft versions, only 1.20+ (you can still download the old version for 1.16.2â€“1.19).
