- Throw food at stray cats or wolves to attempt to tame them. They will eat any food thrown by players if they are close enough to it.
  - Wolves will react the same way as if you just gave them a bone (1/3 chance of being tamed).
  - Cats are picky eaters, so food consumed this way will only have a 20% chance of taming them.
