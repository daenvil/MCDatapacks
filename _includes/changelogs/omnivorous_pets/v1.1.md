- Stray cats now stop their movement when a nearby player is holding food in their hand: 
  - The cat will look at the player for a few seconds expecting to receive food, and then will continue with their normal behaviour.
  - Attacking a cat will temporarily disable this feature.
  - **This option can be disabled** using the command `/function dnv.user:cat_waiting` (admin only, use the same command again to reenable it).
- Reduced cats' eating range to 1 block.
- Slightly optimized functions.
- Improved datapack logo.
- Updated for Minecraft 1.20:
  - Changed `pack_format` to 14.
