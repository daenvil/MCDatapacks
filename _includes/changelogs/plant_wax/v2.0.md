- Reworked recipes into the new system. This datapack should now perform a lot better as it no longer needs its previous custom smelting framework.
- Removed advancements from the standalone datapacks. Now those are only available in the full Vegancraft datapack.
- Optimized functions to improve performance wherever I could.
- Added "give" function for the plant wax item. The command is ``/function dnv.plant_wax:give/plant_wax``
