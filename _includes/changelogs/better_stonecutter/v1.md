- Products of stonecutting are given recipes so they can be cut again into smaller or equal-size items (for example, stairs into slabs).

- Some items can now be obtained through stonecutting:
  - Stone/blackstone ⇒ pressure plates, buttons
  - Nether Bricks ⇒ Nether Brick fence, Nether brick
  - Quartz ⇒ Nether quartz
  - Sandstone ⇒ sand
  - Copper ⇒ copper ingots
  - Iron ⇒ doors, pressure plates, iron bars, iron ingots
  - Gold ⇒ pressure plates, gold ingots
  - Prismarine ⇒ prismarine shards
  - Amethyst blocks or clusters ⇒ amethyst shards
- You can switch between stone types (and their products) more easily:
  - Stone can be cut into: smooth stone, stone bricks, cobblestone
  - Stone bricks can be cut into cobblestone
  - Mossy cobblestone can be cut into cobblestone
  - Mossy stone bricks can be cut into: mossy cobblestone, regular stone bricks, cobblestone
  - Smooth and polished variants can be cut into their regular counterparts
  - Prismarine bricks can be cut into prismarine
  - Cracked brick variants can be obtained from their regular counterparts
  - Deepslate can be cut into all deepslate variants (deepslate doesn’t make much sense right now but it is how they decided to do it in vanilla for some reason, at least now you can use full deepslate in the stonecutter, instead of having to manually mine it for its cobbled variant)
- To avoid flooding the stonecutter UI, some blocks with a lot of variants (deepslate, stone, blackstone) are not given all possible recipes directly. Instead, they are only given the recipes for the smaller blocks of the same variant and the equivalent blocks of other variants, which you can cut then into smaller blocks if desired.

- Copper can be deoxidized and dewaxed with the stonecutter. Copper blocks can be cut into 6 stairs instead of 4, which makes more sense.
