- There are now **two available versions** of the datapack: the **"OP" version**, which continues the preceding philosophy, and the **"vanilla-balanced" version**, which follows the vanilla conversion rates much more strictly.
- Changes in the "OP" version:
  - Nerfed recipes (to avoid exploting them for extra fuel):
    - Planks (and extended to all subrecipes):
      - ⇒ 1 fence/fence gate (instead of 2)
      - ⇒ 1 trapdoor (instead of 2)
    - Boats:
      - ⇒ 2 fences/fence gates (instead of 5)
      - ⇒ 2 trapdoors (instead of 5)
    - Signs/hanging signs can no longer be cut into fences/fence gates.

- Changes in the "vanilla-balanced" version (in comparison with the "OP" version):
  - Fences, fence gates, doors, trapdoors, pressure plates, signs, ladders, chests, barrels, chiseled bookshelves, and composters cannot be cutted from planks, they can only be cutted from logs/wood (in reduced quantities).
  - Planks (and extended to all subrecipes):
    - ⇒ 1 button (instead of 4)
    - ⇒ 1 bowl (instead of 4)
    - ⇒ 2 sticks (instead of 4)
  - Boats/chest boats:
    - ⇒ 2 signs (instead of 5)
    - ⇒ 2 pressure plates (instead of 5)
    - ⇒ 6/8 bowls (instead of 10/12)
    - ⇒ 4/5 ladders (instead of 5/6)
  - Signs/hanging signs cannot be cut into pressure plates.

- Technical changes:
  - Changed `pack_format` to 15.
