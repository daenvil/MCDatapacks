- **Added stonecutting recipes for bamboo wood:**
  - Roughly summarised: follows the same pattern as the rest of wood types, except that converting bamboo blocks to lesser blocks/items has half the output count as logs/stems (since bamboo blocks provide 2 planks instead of 4).
- **Added chiseled bookshelf recipes**
  - They are treated the same (within the recipes of this datapack) as composters, barrels, and chests.
- **Added hanging sign recipes**
  - They are treated the same (within the recipes of this datapack) as regular signs, except that they are not directly craftable through the stonecutter, since they require chains to be crafted.
- **Balance changes:**
  - All recipes were revised so their output makes more sense. Now all recipe outputs follow a common logic based on how much wood each item has (following vanilla recipes and fuel values).
    - This caused a lot of recipes to be nerfed, preventing them from being exploited for extra smelting fuel.
- **Miscellanea**:
  - Restructured datapack files for easier development.
  - Simplified advancements and recipes: datapack size was reduced by ~40%.
  - Added README.txt file.
  - Improved pack.png.
