- When eating a chorus fruit pie near endermen (<64 blocks), they may become angry towards you.

### Datapack compatibility
_Not yet implemented_

This datapack was made to be compatible with my _[Plant-based Foods](https://github.com/daenvil/vegancraft/wiki/Plant%E2%80%90based-Foods)_ datapack. As such, **if _Plant-based Foods_ is also installed, you will be able to replace eggs with wheat or potato in any of the recipes**. The custom naming and advancements of that datapack are also supported by the foods in this datapack. None of this will affect you if you don't have that datapack.
