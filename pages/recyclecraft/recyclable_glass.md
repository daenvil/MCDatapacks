## Features
This datapack adds the following recipes:

- Crafting table:

  - 6 **glass panes** ⇒ 1 **glass block**
  - **Tinted glass** is craftable with **any dyed glass block**, instead of just undyed glass.

- Smelting (furnace):

  - Any **dyed or tinted glass** ⇒ **Undyed glass**
  - Any **dyed glass pane** ⇒ **Undyed glass pane**
  - **Glass bottle** ⇒ **Glass pane**

## Considerations

- The bottle⇒pane and panes⇒glass recipes are meant to disallow you from getting all your glass blocks back (for balance and realism)
- The 6 panes ⇒ 1 block recipe was chosen to represent the 6 sides of the block as one pane each.
