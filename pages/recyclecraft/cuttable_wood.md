## Features

Some general things this datapack allows you to do:

- Use less wood crafting wooden items.
- Craft fences and signs directly from planks or logs, without having to craft sticks first.
- Repurpose items, cutting them into smaller ones (for example, doors into trapdoors; stairs into slabs, etc.).
- Convert fences into fence gates and viceversa.

The number of recipes this datapack adds is too big to list all of them here. Here you have a summary (click to expand):

## Considerations

- The datapack was designed to be as balanced as possible while making it make sense. No recipe should be exploitable to get free items/blocks.
- However, it is possible to slightly exploit the recipes to get "free" fuel. I nerfed this down as much as possibles, but this is also the case in vanilla crafting recipes (for example, by crafting logs into slabs you get 4x fuel), so I decided to not get rid of the possibility alltogether.
- The recipes were also designed taking into account [Vanilla Tweak's _Back to Blocks_ datapack](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/crafting-tweaks/){:target="_blank"}, I recommend using that datapack along with this one to make the most efficient use of wooden blocks.
- The [_Better Stonecutter_](better_stonecutter.html) datapack extends this same philosophy to mineral blocks. I recommend using them together.
- An accidental synergy with this datapack is with [_More Compostable Items_](more_compostable_items.html). Since it lets you compost sticks, you can use both datapacks together to compost wood blocks, by first cutting them into sticks and them composting them. This makes sense, as wood is compostable in real life.
