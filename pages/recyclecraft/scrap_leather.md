## Features
This datapack adds the following recipes:

- Leather **chestplates**, **leggings**, and **horse armor** ⇒ 2 pieces of leather each.
- Leather **helmets**, **boots**, **saddle**, and **bundle** ⇒ 1 piece of leather each.
- Any **books** and **item frames** ⇒ 1 piece of leather for each 4 items.
- 1 **leather** ⇒ 4 rabbit hides

Now you can recycle those items to craft more useful ones!

## Considerations

- The leather ⇒ rabbit hides recipe is supposed to help craft a bundle if you only have leather, plus it makes sense that you can just tear apart a piece of leather in smaller pieces.
