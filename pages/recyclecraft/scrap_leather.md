## Features
This datapack adds the following recipes:

- Leather **chestplates**, **leggings**, and **horse armor** ⇒ 2 pieces of leather each.
- Leather **helmets**, **boots**, and **saddle** ⇒ 1 piece of leather each.
- Any **books** and **item frames** ⇒ 1 piece of leather for each 4 items.

Now you can recycle those items to craft more useful ones!

## Considerations

- When the bundle is finally officially added to the game, I will implement it into this datapack, maybe adding a leather ⇒ 4 rabbit hides recipe. For now, I consider it complete.
