## Features

{% include comments/tip.html content="There are two versions of this datapack:<br/><br/>&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;The **\"OP\" version**: adds recipes according to my own judgement of what is balanced, but may be considered to be over-powered by some.<br/>&nbsp;&#x2022;&nbsp;The **\"vanilla-balanced\" version**: adds recipes more accordingly to the conversion rates of the regular vanilla recipes, to make the datapack less exploitable to those that prefer a more restricted experience.<br/><br/>See below for a summary of the differences between versions." %}

Products of stonecutting are given recipes so they can be cut again into smaller or equal-size items (for example, stairs into slabs).

- Some items can now be obtained through stonecutting:
    - Stone/blackstone &#x21D2; pressure plates, buttons
    - Nether Bricks &#x21D2; Nether Brick fence, Nether brick
    - Quartz &#x21D2; Nether quartz\*
    - Sandstone &#x21D2; sand\*
    - Copper &#x21D2; copper ingots, copper grates, copper doors, etc.
    - Iron &#x21D2; doors, pressure plates, iron bars, iron ingots, chains\*
    - Gold &#x21D2; pressure plates, gold ingots
    - Prismarine &#x21D2; prismarine shards\*
    - Amethyst blocks or clusters &#x21D2; amethyst shards\*
    - Mud bricks &#x21D2; Packed mud

\* *These recipes marked with "\*" are only available on the "OP" version of the datapack.*

{% include comments/important.html content='If you don\'t like some of the recipes, it\'s possible to remove them by simply going into the datapack\'s <code>data/dnv.better_stonecutter/recipes/</code> folder and removing the recipes that you don\'t want (they are organized in subfolders, so it is easy to identify them and bulk-remove them).' %}

- You can switch between stone types (and their products) more easily:
    - Stone can be cut into: stone bricks, cobblestone
    - Stone bricks can be cut into cobblestone
    - Mossy cobblestone can be cut into cobblestone
    - Mossy stone bricks can be cut into: mossy cobblestone, regular stone bricks, cobblestone
    - Smooth and polished variants can be cut into their regular counterparts
    - Prismarine bricks can be cut into prismarine
    - Cracked brick variants can be obtained from their regular counterparts
    - Deepslate can be cut into all deepslate variants (*deepslate doesn't make much sense right now but it is how they decided to do it in vanilla for some reason, at least now you can use full deepslate in the stonecutter, instead of having to manually mine it for its cobbled variant*)

- To avoid flooding the stonecutter UI, some blocks with a lot of variants (deepslate, stone, blackstone) are not given all possible recipes directly. Instead, they are only given the recipes for the smaller blocks of the same variant and the equivalent blocks of other variants, which you can cut then into smaller blocks if desired.

- Copper can be deoxidized and dewaxed with the stonecutter. Copper blocks can be cut into 5 stairs instead of 4, which makes more sense.

### Differences in vanilla-balanced version with respect to the "OP" version:

- Things that cannot be obtained from cutting:
  - Amethyst shards, sand, red sand, quartz, and prismarine shards
  - Copper doors/trapdoors
  - Chains

- Things that are more expensive:
  - Lightning rods
  - Iron trapdoors and bars
  - Pressure plates and buttons
  - Nether brick fences

## Considerations

- This datapack might make it easier to obtain certain types of blocks, but you have the option to remove those recipes manually.
- The recipes were designed taking into account [Vanilla Tweak's _Back to Blocks_ datapack](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/crafting-tweaks/){:target="_blank"}, I recommend using that datapack along with this one to make the most efficient use of blocks.
- The [_Cuttable Wood_](cuttable_wood.html) datapack extends this same philosophy to wooden blocks. I recommend using them together.
