## Features

- When stripping a pale oak log (or wood), there is a 1/4 chance that a resin clump appears on it.
- Your axe's Fortune enchantment level gives you an extra chance of obtaining a second resin clump, topping at a total average of 1 resin per log with Fortune III.

### Vegancraft

This is a standalone datapack, but it is designed as a part of [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html), a collection of datapacks with the goal of making a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features.

## Reasoning

In vanilla Minecraft, resin is mostly a cosmetic item, yet it's locked behind attacking a Creaking. This datapack allows a pacifist and more realistic way of obtaining it, since resin is a common product from trees in real life.
