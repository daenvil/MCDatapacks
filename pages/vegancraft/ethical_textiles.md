#### Plant-based string
Vines, sugar cane, and dripleaves can be used to craft **string**. Use 4 of these strings to craft vegan "wool".

#### Armor scales
Crafted with a diamond, two strings, and a slime ball. It's an alternative to **armadillo scute**. Use it to craft wolf armor without using armadillos.

#### Alternative brush recipe
With this datapack, you can craft a regular brush using **4 string instead of a feather**.

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/ethical_textiles/screenshots/recipes/brush.png" alt="Armor Scale recipe" align="center" width="300" %}

#### Alternative item frame recipe
You can also craft a regular item frame using **paper of leather**.

### Recipe book integration

From Minecraft 1.20.5 and later versions, the custom items will appear in the in-game recipe book like any other recipe, and you can filter them using the name of this datapack:

{% include comments/important.html content="Prior to Minecraft 1.20.5, the datapack worked differently, with the custom recipes outputting a knowledge book. I recommend playing on Minecraft 1.20.5 or superior, which is much better due to this change." %}

### Vegancraft

This is a standalone datapack, but was designed as a part of [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html), a collection of datapacks with the goal of making a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features.

As part of its integration on Vegancraft, this datapack includes the following additional features:

When playing using the full Vegancraft datapack instead of the standalone Plant-based Foods datapack, the following features are enabled:

- A custom advancement tree.

## Reasoning for the recipes

- Faux leather is based on real-world alternatives for leather, dark oak representing tree bark. Slime/resin represents the plastic substances which are often used in their manufacture.
- Rudimentary beds: I just found it weird how in the early game you need to find sheep in order to sleep, and thought it would make sense to be able to craft beds with more rudimentary materials.
- String: since the most common real-world plants that produce fibers are not in the game (cotton, linen, flax...) I just decided to take the vanilla plants that looked more "stringy" and also sugar cane, because in-game it is already implied that it produces fiber since you make paper from it.
- Faux feathers can be crafted in real life using cloth or leaves. I decided to use leaves for this recipe since they already have a similar shape and can be used to craft arrows, while using wool would make them very easy to get (since you can craft wool from string). The recipe represents leaves sewn together to a small stick in a feather-like shape.
- Since cobweb is rarely used in the game, I just added a simple recipe which represents strings covered in slime to make them sticky.
- Armor scale represents the obvious. It uses a diamond since the wolf armor's protection is similar to that of diamond horse armor, and the strings and slime represent how these scales connect to one another to form an armor.
- The alternative brush recipe is just to have an easier way to obtain a brush without killing birds. Otherwise, you would have to first craft faux feathers, which can be a bit of a pain when you are out exploring.
- I didn't create a "vegan wool" item because of how many color variants there are and the difficult/cumbersome it would be to have a vegan variant for each one of them.
