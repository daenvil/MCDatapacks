{% include comments/note.html content="This resourcepack is the same for all Vegancraft datapacks, meaning you don't need to download it if you are already using another Vegancraft datapack. Just make sure you are using the latest version." %}

{% include installation.html resourcepack=true %}

## Features

### Crafting a magnet fishing rod

Craft a magnet rod with a regular **fishing rod**, an **iron ingot**, and **redstone dust**. The result will look like a knowledge book (or a question mark if you are using the resourcepack), just click on it and you will receive your magnet fishing rod.

{% include comments/warning.html content="When crafting a magnet rod, <b>any enchantment that the regular fishing rod has will be lost!</b> A newly crafted magnet rod is always unenchanted." %}

### Using the magnet rod

You can use the magnet rod just like you would use a regular fishing rod. The only difference is in the items that you will receive. You can find a list of the loot tables below. The **fishing enchantments** (*Lure* and *Luck of the sea*) **also work with this magnet rod**!

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/magnet_fishing/screenshots/enchantments.png" alt="Magnet rod crafting recipe" align="center" width="300" %}

{% include collapsible.html id="loot-list" title="List of loot items" content="<ul><li><b>Main catches</b>: raw iron (70%), iron ingot (20%), iron ore (10%).</li><li><b>Junk</b> (all items are damaged if possible): iron tools and weapons, chainmail armor, bucket, compass, chain, lantern, tripwire hook, rail, iron bars.</li><li><b>Treasure</b> (all items are damaged and enchanted if possible): Damaged anvil, iron armor, shield, iron tools and weapons, crossbow, bow, fishing rod, name tag.</li></ul><p align=center><img class=\"docimage\" src=\"images/vegancraft/magnet_fishing/loot.png\" alt=\"Loot items\" style=\"max-width:600px;\" /></p>" %}

### Custom texture
The resourcepack (downloadable above) is **optional**. If not installed, the magnet rod will look just like a regular fishing rod, but renamed and with enchantment glint.

### Vegancraft
This is a standalone datapack, but was originally designed as a part of [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html), a collection of datapacks with the goal of making a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features. Check out my *[Plant-based Foods](plant-based_foods.html)* datapack if you also want to cook fish substitutes, and some additional features.

## Special thanks

This datapack was originally created as a commission for Nora from the [Vegan Minecraft Server](https://veganminecraft.com/){:target="_blank"}.
