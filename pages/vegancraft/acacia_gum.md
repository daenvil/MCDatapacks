## Features

- When stripping an acacia log (or wood), there is a 1/4 chance that an "acacia gumball" drops from it.
- Your axe's Fortune enchantment level gives you an extra chance of obtaining a second gumball drop, topping at a total average of 1 gumball per log with Fortune III.
- Acacia gumballs behave just as regular slimeballs but have a different texture and name. Use it to craft slime blocks, sticky pistons, etc. without the need of finding and killing slimes.
- ***(New in v1.4)*** Additionally, acacia gumballs can be thrown using right click (like snowballs or eggs). They will drop again when they collide with a block or a mob. They don't make any damage nor make mobs angry.

### Vegancraft

This is a standalone datapack, but it is designed as a part of [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html), a collection of datapacks with the goal of making a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features.

When playing using the full Vegancraft datapack instead of the standalone Plant-based Foods datapack, the following features are enabled:

- Custom advancements.
- Some xp will be awarded each time you get an acacia gumball. If using a Fortune III axe, the amount of xp per gumball is equivalent to that you would get by getting slimeballs by killing slimes.

## Reasoning

On the search of a plant-based alternative for slime, I thought gum was the most similar thing in real life. Both the texture and way of obtaining "Acacia Gumball" are based on real-life acacia gum (also known as *gum arabica*), which is obtained from the bark of acacias.

I decided to restrict this to only acacia (despite other real-life trees producing gum as well) in order to not make the mechanic too easy and exploitable. Acacia has the advantage of being available only on savannas (encouraging players to explore, just as they need to explore to find slimes), and having small trunks, which means that it isn't as easily farmed as, for example, spruce or jungle trees.

The throwing mechanics is mostly just for fun, and also to have an alternative for throwing eggs.
