## Features

- When stripping an acacia log (or wood), there is a 1/4 chance that an "acacia gumball" drops from it.
- Your axe's Fortune enchantment level gives you an extra chance of obtaining a second gumball drop, topping at a total average of 1 gumball per log with Fortune III.
- Acacia gumball behaves just as a regular slimeball but has a different texture and name. Use it to craft slime blocks, sticky pistons, etc. without the need of finding and killing slimes.

### Vegancraft

This is a standalone datapack, but it is designed as a part of [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html), a collection of datapacks with the goal of making a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features.

As part of its integration on Vegancraft, this datapack includes the following additional features:
- A custom advancement.
- Some xp will be awarded each time you get an acacia gumball. If using a Fortune III axe, the amount of xp per gumball is equivalent to that you would get by getting slimeballs by killing slimes.
- In conjunction with my *[Ethical Textiles](ethical_textiles.html)* datapack, this datapack allows you to craft vegan leather.

If, for any reason, you want to remove these features, you can use the command **<code>/function dnv.vegancraft:toggle</code>** to disable them. You can also use that command to turn them on again.

## Reasoning

On the search of a plant-based alternative for slime, I thought gum was the most similar thing in real life. Both the texture and way of obtaining "Acacia Gumball" are based on real-life acacia gum (also known as *gum arabica*), which is obtained from the bark of acacias.

I decided to restrict this to only acacia (despite other real-life trees producing gum as well) in order to not make the mechanic too easy and exploitable. Acacia has the advantage of being available only on savannas (encouraging players to explore, just as they need to explore to find slimes), and having small trunks, which means that it isn't as easily farmed as, for example, spruce or jungle trees.
