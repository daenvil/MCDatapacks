### Resourcepack

Most of these datapacks contain custom textures and item names. The Vegancraft resourcepack is needed in order to view them properly. For simplicity, this resourcepack is the same for all datapacks, and is available on the [Downloads](#full-datapack-download) section or in the page of any single datapack that uses it.

### Customization options

- **These individual datapacks are entirely modular**, meaning that if you don't like one (or more) of them, you can just download all the rest of them without worrying about compatibility issues. The "full" datapack (downloadable at the top of the page) is just an optimized merged version of all of these datapacks.

- As detailed on the individual datapacks, some features, such as custom advancements or XP rewards for crafting vegan items, can be disabled by using the command <code>/function dnv.vegancraft:toggle</code>. You can also use that command to turn them on again. This allows to play in an even more vanilla way, if desired.

## Future Features
Planned datapacks that are still in progress

### Vegan Brewing

Vegan alternatives for brewing ingredients.

### Copper horns

Craft horns using copper and wax.
