### New recipes

{% include comments/important.html content="The Vegancraft Resourcepack (download above) is required to see the new textures in game." %}

#### Plant-based milk
Crafted with a water bucket, an empty bucket, and 6 wheat seeds, pumpkin seeds, potatoes, or sunflowers. *Behaves as a milk bucket*.

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/plant_milk.png" alt="Plant milk recipe" align="center" width="300" %}

#### Egg baking alternatives
**Pumpkin pies** and **cakes** can be crafted by replacing the egg in the vanilla recipe with wheat or a potato.

  {% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/cake.gif" alt="Cake recipe" width="300" %}
</p>

#### Vegan honey
Crafted in two ways:
- A water bucket, an empty bottle, and 6 flowers.
- An empty bottle and 4 apples.

*Behaves as a honey bottle*.

  {% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/apple_honey.png" alt="Apple honey recipe" width="300" %}
</p>

#### Seitan steak
Crafted with 3 wheat and either mushroom stew or beetroot soup. *Behaves as a steak*.

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/seitan.png" alt="Seitan steak recipe" align="center" width="300" %}

Alternatively, use hay bales instead of wheat to produce seitan more efficiently:

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/seitan_hay.png" alt="Seitan steak recipe with hay bale instead of wheat" align="center" width="300" %}

#### Seitan stew
Crafted in the same way as rabbit stew, but using a seitan steak instead of rabbit. *Behaves as rabbit stew*.

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/seitan_stew.png" alt="Seitan stew recipe" align="center" width="300" %}

#### Veggie burger
Crafted with bread, beetroot, and a brown mushroom. *Behaves as a cooked porkchop*.

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/veggie_burger.png" alt="Veggie burger recipe" align="center" width="300" %}

#### Not-fish fillet
Crafted with a (seitan) steak and 3 kelp. *Behaves as raw cod (so you can attract cats with it and tame them), but has same nutrition as cooked cod*.

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/notfish_fillet.png" alt="Not-fish fillet recipe" align="center" width="300" %}

#### Not-salmon fillet
Crafted with a carrot, kelp, and a (vegan) honey bottle. *Behaves as raw salmon (so you can attract cats with it and tame them), but has same nutrition as cooked salmon*.

{% include image/basic.html src="vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipes/notsalmon_fillet.png" alt="Not-salmon fillet recipe" align="center" width="300" %}

### Recipe book integration

From Minecraft 1.20.5 and later versions, the custom items will appear in the in-game recipe book like any other recipe, and you can filter them using the name of this datapack:

{% include image/basic.html src='vegancraft/vegan_food/screenshots/recipe_book.png' alt='All custom items showing up in the in-game recipe book' align='center' width='600' nn=true %}

However, there's a limitation which is kind of annoying, which is that custom items are not automatically recognized as ingredients, so you will still need to put them manually in the crafting grid. This the case only for the recipes that require a custom item as ingredient, which are: not-fish fillet (requires a seitan steak), not-salmon fillet (requires a vegan honey bottle), and seitan stew (requires a seitan steak). These recipes are shapeless to help with this issue.

{% include comments/important.html content="Prior to Minecraft 1.20.5, the datapack worked differently, with the custom recipes outputting a knowledge book. I recommend playing on Minecraft 1.20.5 or superior, which is much better due to this change." %}

### Vegan ingredients detection

Since some plant-based foods can be also crafted with animal ingredients (such as crafting a "seitan stew" with a cow steak instead of a seitan steak), the datapack will detect if you are using vegan ingredients or not when crafting these items, labelling them if they are not vegan. Vegan and non-vegan items do not stack.

Hopefully, Minecraft will add proper ingredient detection in the future so this can be improved.

### Vegancraft

This is a standalone datapack, but was designed as a part of [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html), a collection of datapacks with the goal of making a vegan gamestyle possible in a vanilla-like way without missing any game features.

When playing using the full Vegancraft datapack instead of the standalone Plant-based Foods datapack, the following features are enabled:

- A custom advancement tree.
- Some xp will be awarded when crafting seitan steaks and not-fish/not-salmon fillets. The amount of xp is roughly equivalent to that you would get by getting those items the "regular" way (breeding and killing cows, fishing).

## Reasoning for the recipes

- All of the plant milk recipes are based on real plant-based milks (the sunflower representing sunflower seeds).
- The egg replacements --wheat and potato-- represent wheat flour and potato starch, respectively, both used in real-life egg-free baking.
- Flower honey represents a kind of vegan honey that can be made by boiling flowers in water. Apple honey represents apple syrup, as there are also recipes for vegan honey made from apple syrup or juice.
- Seitan is made by soaking wheat flour in water and filtering it. The stew/soup represents a marinade to give the seitan steak flavour.
- Not-fish fillet is based on real recipes for "vegan fish", although in real life it is more common to use tofu for this.
- Veggie burgers and not-salmon fillets are also based on a real-world recipes.

## Known issues and solutions
- As mentioned before, custom ingredients aren't automatically filled when clicking on a recipe in the recipe book. You will have to manually put them in the grid.

## Notes for developers
If you are creating a datapack that adds custom food and you want your custom food to be recognized by this datapack, just do the following:
- If it is a vegan food retexturing a non-vegan food item, just include <code>"dnv.vegan": true</code> in the <code>custom_data</code> component of the item.
- If it is a non-vegan food retexturing a vegan food item, just include <code>"dnv.vegan": false</code> in the <code>custom_data</code> component of the item.
