Introducing the first "official" release of Vegancraft!

It's been a long time since I started working on this as a side project and I'm very happy to see it progressed this much. Don't get me wrong, there are still ton of features I would like to include, like vegan brewing or story progression, but at some point I had to draw the line and set an achievable goal, which is this 1.0 release. Expect more in the future!

This release includes my latest datapack, [Magnet Fishing](magnet_fishing.html), which allows you to use fishing rods to obtain iron items from the water. It also includes the latest updates to all my other datapacks, much more polished and optimized. The two biggest changes being:

- Custom recipes now appear in the recipe book and consistently detect whether you are using all vegan ingredients or not.
- Cats don't run away from you anymore when trying to feed them with non-fish food!

See the full release notes below. Enjoy!
