This is a pretty huge update (compared to previous ones). Most of this stuff was already prepared from back in December but I didn't have time to include it with the MC 1.21.4 update, and since the game's updates are more frequent now and you never know what's going to break, I decided to just hold it until 1.21.5 (and it was a good decision, since a lot of things broke with that update as well).

This update mainly introduces vegan villager trades, which is something that I always wanted to do, but surprinsingly it's pretty complex to make in a datapack, and also now you'll be able to throw acacia gum balls, which is pretty fun.

I'm also finally introducing a vegan way of obtaining resin (which wasn't possible until now, since Mojang made it so you have to hit the Creaking to obtain resin for some reason), and I'm planning to also release this as a standalone datapack.
