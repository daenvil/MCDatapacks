This is an update mainly to adapt the datapack for the new Minecraft 1.21 update, but I also took the opportunity to add recipes for all the non-vegan items that were missing from this datapack. See below for the recipes. Thanks to the people from the [Vegan Minecraft server](veganminecraft.com) for their feedback!
