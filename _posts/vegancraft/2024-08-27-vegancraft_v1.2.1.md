This is mainly a balance patch to address some issues found by players in the Vegan Minecraft server. Until recently I didn't have any feedback at all on the datapack so I was balancing things judging by my own experince. It's nice to now have other players trying it and giving me ideas :)

Gunpowder and leather were found to be too expensive, so it was decided to multiply their outputs by 3. Since the complaint about leather was about using it to craft item frames, I also added a new recipe for item frames that doesn't require leather (I don't know why this isn't already the case in the base game).

Another complaint was about the expensiveness of the Nether star. This recipe was and is just a placeholder, as ideally I would like to implement a more immersive mechanic similar to summoning the Wither but in a pacifist way in order to obtain a Nether star. Nevertheless, I cheapened the Nether star recipe, and I also added it to ancient city loot, as per a player's suggestion (and I think it makes sense).

There are other small changes listed below.
