I was planning to do a bigger update with some new features, but the holidays got in the way, so I decided to just make a small update ASAP to be compatible with 1.21.4. This required some work since Minecraft changed the whole way in which custom-textured items are defined, so I had to fix the whole resourcepack *and* make it compatible with already existing items that used the old format.

I'll try to make a new update with the content I had planned soon.

PS: resin is now in the game, but you need to attack a mob to obtain it... Mojang why
