Finally bringing an vegan alternative to the happy ghasts: **hot air balloons**. I'll probably publish this as a separate datapack at some point, but right now it's probably still a bit buggy (not entirely my fault, turns out happy ghasts released with lots of bugs). One thing that surprised me when developing this is that the balloons actually have a lot of decorative potential, I can see how they could be integrated on some builds.

Also excuse the shitty textures of the balloons lol.
