So this is the first big update of Vegancraft, and I'm now near to my original vision for this datapack. Custom items are now much better thanks to Minecraft 1.20.5, and I've added tons of new features that are not available as standalone datapacks:

- New items to allow **brewing any potion in a vegan way**.
- New alternatives to common decoration items such as **inks and dyes, mob heads, froglights**...
- New **copper horns** (an alternative to goat horns).
- Two new **banner patterns**.
- **XP from farming plants!**

Check the datapack's page to not miss any feature.
