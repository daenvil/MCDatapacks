This update mainly adds craftable vault keys, allowing to get trial chamber vault loot without killing monsters. I kind of feel like this method will be too easy, as the keys are pretty cheap and I don't think it's too hard to go around trial spawners to get to the vaults (they tend to be separated). But I'll wait to hear some feedback in order to balance (or not) this.

Of course, ideally, I would like a different way of obtaining keys altogether, maybe some sort of peaceful challenge, but I'll approach that in the future, hopefully.
