So this was going to be a small update (and I guess in the user side it is), but thanks to one of the new technical upgrades in Minecraft 1.20, now custom recipes are much easier than before. My old way of detecting ingredients is now obsolete, and the new way is 100% consistent! The custom recipes now also show up in the recipe book, so I took the opportunity to change the textures of the knowledge book to a sort of question mark, which represents the output of a custom recipe. Now you can go to the recipe book, look for the question mark, and there you have all the custom recipes!

I also upgraded the language files of the resourcepack, adding fallbacks in case you don't have the resourcepack installed and translating all the custom advancements. Finally, all the functions have been revised and optimized, preparing the way to the first "official release" of [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html).
