This datapack was already included in the [Vegancraft 1.4](vegancraft_v1.4.html) release, but I didn't have time to properly release it as a separate datapack until now. It's basically a copy of my [Acacia Gum](acacia_gum.html) datapack but for obtaining resin, which in vanilla requires attacking the Creaking.
