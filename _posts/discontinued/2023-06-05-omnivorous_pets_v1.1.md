Everythin has been updated for Minecraft 1.20!

The main change is the change to cat taming mechanics: **cats will now stop their movement when a nearby player is holding food** in their hand, looking at the player for a few seconds expecting to receive food, and then they will continue with their normal behaviour. This option can be disabled by admins. Since in the previous version cats would just run away like they usually do, their eating range as increased. Now that this has been fixed, their eating ranges is 1 block, the same as wolves.

In addition, all the functions have been revised and optimized, preparing the way to the first "official release" of [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html).
