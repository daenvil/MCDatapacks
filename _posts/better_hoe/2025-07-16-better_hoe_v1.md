I wanted to do a datapack like this for a long time, as I feel enchantments are almost completely wasted on hoes in vanilla Minecraft, and also there's little progression in farming, with almost no reason to upgrade your hoe unless you manually farm large areas of crops. I also wanted to avoid adding new custom enchantments when the game already has some that fit perfectly well for this use, so I came up with this design:

- **Efficiency** usually makes it faster to mine blocks, which doesn't make sense in farming since everything is insta-mined, so instead I made it affect a larger area, allowing to tile and harvest multiple crops in one hit, making farming large areas of crops much faster. On the other hand, the durability of the hoe will suffer from this increased effect, giving more reason to upgrade and maintain it.
- **Silk Touch** made me think of mining blocks with care, provoking as little damage as possible, so it made sense to me that it would have the effect of harvesting a crop but leaving a part of it behind so it can grow again (effectively the same as auto-seeding). Combining this with Efficiency removes the tediousness of harvesting and then replanting large areas block by block.
- **Fortune** is ok in vanilla, but wheat and beetroot weren't affected by it, so I fixed that.
