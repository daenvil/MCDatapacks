I made this for my own use since I found the trial chamber loot very underwhelming, but figured I might as well share it here :) I basically removed almost all loot items that I consider useless (tuff, planks, stone tools), and added some more rewarding loot like diamond tools/armor, as well as adjusting the chances on some of the existing loot.
