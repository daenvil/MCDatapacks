Just a quick update preparing for the Minecraft 1.20 release. Added the new items that match with the datapack, **I decided to add the smithing templates ⇒ diamond recipe**, since I guess it makes sense to provide a use to them (I'm guessing in late game —or if you don't care about aesthetics— you don't really need them for anything), and it makes sense that you can scrap them for diamond since diamond is used to duplicate them. Since I added this recipe, I also added diamond recipes for the jukebox and the enchanting table, for consistency.
