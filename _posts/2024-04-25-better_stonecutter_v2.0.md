As I told you [on the 1.20.5 update post](update_MC1.20.5.html), Minecraft 1.20.5 introduced a lot of changes in the technical side of datapacks. I'm slowly getting everything up to date. [Cuttable wood](cuttable_wood.html) was the first updated datapack, and tnow is the turn of Better Stonecutter. Next will be [More Compostable Items](more_compostable_items.html), hopefully on the following days or maybe even today.

This update introduces a lot of changes in Better Stonecutter. The main one being that there are now *two* versions of the datapack, following the same philosophy as with [Cuttable wood](cuttable_wood.html). I think this was needed, since this datapack was introducing quite a lot of "balance-breaking" features that I personally liked but might deter some people from using the datapack due to feeling cheesy. Now there's the "vanilla-balanced" version for those people, with all the features of the regular "OP" version but more restricted to what's possible in vanilla Minecraft.
