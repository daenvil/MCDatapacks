As I told you [on the latest post](update_MC1.20.5.html), Minecraft 1.20.5 introduced a lot of changes in the technical side of datapacks. I'm slowly getting everything up to date. Cuttable wood is the first updated datapack, and then will follow [Better Stonecutter](better_stonecutter.html) and [More Compostable Items](more_compostable_items.html) on the next days, if nothing goes wrong.

This update of cuttable wood is mostly a technical one to give support to the new Minecraft update, but it also introduces some minor balance changes that were needed.
