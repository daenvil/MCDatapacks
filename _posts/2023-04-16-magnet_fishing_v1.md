Hello again! I'm finally more free to work on my datapacks :D. This one was already in my waiting list for a long time, since I created it back in December as a comission for the [Vegan Minecraft Server](https://veganminecraft.com/){:target="_blank"} (thanks, Nora!). This version is adapted to regular survival Minecraft, with a custom craftable magnet rod with which you can fish iron from the water! And, since it fits so well with my [Vegancraft](vegancraft.html) project, I decided to include it as a nice addition to the collection, despite this datapack being completely standalone.

Find more info in the datapack page! Hope you enjoy it!
