This pre-release **introduces the new bamboo blocks, hanging signs, and chiseled bookshelves** to the mechanics of this datapack, in anticipation for the upcoming Minecraft 1.20 update. It also comes with **a lot of balance changes**, to prevent this datapack from being exploitable in vanilla survival.

It will be in beta version as I'm still open to make some small balance changes, and will be until 1.20 comes out, just in case they make some big change that I need to adjust for.

{% include comments/tip.html content='Despite being intended for 1.20 features, **this version also works with 1.19.3 snapshots without having 1.20 features enabled**, at least from Pre-release 1 onwards (tested on 1.19.3-pre2).' %}
