As I told you [on the 1.20.5 update post](update_MC1.20.5.html), Minecraft 1.20.5 introduced a lot of changes in the technical side of datapacks. I'm slowly getting everything up to date. [Cuttable wood](cuttable_wood.html) and [Better Stonecutter](better_stonecutter.html) were already updated. Now is the turn of *More Compostable Items*.

This is a mostly technical update, fixing compatibility with the new Minecraft update and optimizing the datapack functions a bit. Feature-wise, I added compostability support to the new **armadillo scute**, and removed raw animal meats from the compostable items, since I found out they are not composted in real life.
