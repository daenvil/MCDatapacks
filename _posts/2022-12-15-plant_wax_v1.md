Finally releasing my datapack for **plant-based wax**! You'll now be able to obtain and use wax obtained from plants, avoiding the need for using bees to wax copper and craft candles. The recipes in this datapack are inspired by real-world waxes, mainly _[palm wax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnauba_wax)_ and _[candelilla wax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candelilla_wax)_. Find more info in the datapack page!

This datapack was particularly challenging as it implements custom NBT smelting recipes, which are not supported by the recipe system of the game. I implemented a custom system using marker entities on furnaces, so the integration of these new recipes in the game is as seamless as it can be, you won't realise that they are not vanilla! The system is, IMO, well optimized, and I tested it to ensure that it doesn't cause performance losses. It can even be generalized to include more custom smelting recipes, so maybe in the future I will publish a tutorial on that, as well.

Hope you enjoy the datapack!
