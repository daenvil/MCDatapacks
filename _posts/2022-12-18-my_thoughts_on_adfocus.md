Back in July of this year (almost 5 months since now), I decided to start using AdFocus links in my most popular datapacks, in an attempt to make some bucks this hobby. After this time, I can say confidently that **it's not worth it**, at all.

AdFocus advertises providing as much as $26 per 1k unique clicks for US users, going lower in other countries, but most other countries that are usual Minecraft users are in the $5â€“$12 range.

Over these last months, as of writing this, **I have more than 5k clicks** in my AdFocus links. Which is more or less what I had in mind (~1k clicks/month), expecting to get around $5 dollars per month, at least. _"It would be a nice little extra to compensate for what consumes a decent part of my free time"_, I thought.

AdFocus also requires you to have $10 earned dollars in order to get paid. **Guess when I got to those $10? That's right, just this month, as of writing this**. That's like... $2 per 1k clicks, way less than advertised, even judging by their lowest rates, and considering most of my traffic comes from the US, Europe, and Brazil.

I was already hesitant, when I decided to start doing this, to lock some of my datapacks behind god-knows-what advertisements, and AdFocus seemed by far like the best option among the available ones, but... yeah, it's just worthless.

So, moving on, I will be reverting my links to be totally ad-free and direct, like they were meant to be. I guess I'm writing this just as a message in a bottle to whoever is searching for information about this kind of platforms, as I found actual experience pretty hard to find when starting.
