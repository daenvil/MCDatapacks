This is just a quick update to include the new **cherry wood** into the datapack! everything else is just the same as in the previous release.

This is still a beta since I want to make balance changes to the recipes and still didn't have time to do it. If you don't know, I have been in a break from making datapacks for some months now, due to real-life responsabilities. I expect to be back already in a couple of weeks, though!
