datapack: vegancraft
changelog: v1e

Including my new datapack, [Plant Wax](plant_wax.html), which allows to obtain wax from some leaves and bushes.

This version will be the last "v1x" pre-release. The next one will be the first "official release" (v1), with all the current datapacks well polished (and maybe with a new one?).

Previous Minecraft versions (1.18.x and lower) will not be supported from now on.
