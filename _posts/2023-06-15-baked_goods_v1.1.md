This was the last of my datapacks left to update for Minecraft 1.20. There were quite a few things I needed to change in this one, but now everything should be working fine. There are no gameplay changes except regarding the recipe book: you are now able to unlock recipes and look them up in the recipe book, just like vanilla recipes, except that they appear as a knowledge book, of course.

Bon appetit!
