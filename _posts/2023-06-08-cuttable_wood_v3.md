This is the new release for the Minecraft 1.20 version. Now this datapack features **two different versions**:

- The **\"OP\" version**: adds recipes according to my own judgement of what is balanced, but may be considered to be over-powered by some. This is the alike to the older versions of this datapack.
- The **\"vanilla-balanced\" version**: adds recipes more accordingly to the conversion rates of the regular vanilla wood recipes, to make the datapack less exploitable to those that prefer a more restricted experience.

In this update, I added a lot of balance changes to avoid exploiting the recipes as much as possible, now I think everything should be properly balanced. Check the datapack page to see all the recipes of both versions!
