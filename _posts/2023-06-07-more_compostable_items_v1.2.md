datapack: more_compostable_items
changelog: v1.2
---

A small update integrating the new 1.20 items in the datapack (the only new one that this datapack makes compostable is the calibrated sculk sensor, if you want to compost that for whatever reason :P). I also implemented some small optimizations that in theory should improve the performance of the datapack (I didn't notice any permormance issues before this, but I like doing things right).

The new `return` command has proved to be really helpful in datapack coding, so I implemented it and this new version of the datapack is only compatible with MC 1.20+.

And nothing much more to say, everything should be ready for when 1.20 releases soon, if Mojang doesn't change anything. Enjoy it!
