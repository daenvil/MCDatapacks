I'm finally ready to release my Vegancraft datapacks updated to Minecraft 1.20.5+. I'll be releasing them slowly one by one as I want to ensure that everything is working correctly. When all of them are released, **I'll be releasing the new version of the full Vegancraft datapack, which will include new exclusive features**!

Now, for what concerns *Plant-based Foods*, the technical changes in 1.20.5 are proving to be great for custom items and recipes, so I was able to improve the datapack by a lot and also add some new foods which I felt would fit well with the rest. Now you will be able to see all the custom items directly in the recipe book, and you can even filter them by searching for the name of the datapack:
